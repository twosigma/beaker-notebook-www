    ## General

    **Can I customize my default notebook?**

    Yes, create a notebook you like and save it to
    `~/.beaker/v1/config/default.bkr`. This will be loaded when you
    click the 'New Default Notebook' button, or use the
    Control-Shift-N keyboard equivalent.

    The default notebook that comes with Beaker has Python and R cells
    as well as some tips for beginners.  It would be normal for
    advanced users to customize the included languages (for example,
    adding a standard JAR to their Groovy classpath), remove the tips,
    and add a signature cell with their contact information.

    **How do I add a language to a notebook?**

    Use the Notebook menu to open the Language Manager.  There are
    buttons for each possible language. Each button has a status
    indicator: gray means inactive, green means active, and yellow
    means it is in progress of starting up. Click on the language you
    want to add (one that is gray). It should turn yellow, and after a
    while, depending on how fast your computer is, it should go
    green. Close the manager, and then when you open the language menu
    on any cell, you can set it to the new language and run it.

    **Why doesn't language X work?**

    Most of the languages require a backend that must be installed
    separately.  On the "Getting Started" tab of this web site,
    beneath the download button are the instructions for how to
    install them so they work well with Beaker.  You may need to add
    the location of the implementation of the language to your
    [`beaker.pref.json`](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Language-Preferences).

    **IRuby fails to load?**

    [Ruby does not work with IPython3](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/issues/1).
    Try backing up to version 2.x.

    **Julia fails to load on Windows?**

    Unfortunately Julia on Windows reports a different kernel name than other platforms.
    You can [work around this](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/issues/1602)
    until we fix it.

    **How do I remove a language from a notebook?**

    Start with the Notebook menu, and open the Language Manager and
    click the button for the language you want to remove.  The
    indicator would be green before you click it.  The buttons are
    actually toggles.  Make sure you have first removed all cells from
    the notebook that use that language.  When the language is
    successfully removed, the indicator will go gray.

    **Are there any 3rd party plugins available?**

    Yes, Bayard Rock has written an [F#
    plugin](https://github.com/BayardRock/FsBeaker) that not only
    allows you to program in a modern functional language but also
    gives access to the whole .NET world.  We are working on making
    the installation and distribution experience better.

    **What other customization or init files are there?**

    `~/.beaker/v1/config/beaker.pref.json` is read at startup and can
    modify the UI in many ways.  See its
    [documentation](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Language-Preferences), including how to
    [manipulate the menus](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Configuration-and-Preference).

    **If something crashes or I get disconnected, can I recover my work?**

    Yes, Beaker saves your notebooks as you edit them automatically
    every 60 seconds.  Look in `~/.beaker/v1/var/sessionBackups` to find
    your work.

    Also, if the client becomes disconnected from the server, it tries
    for 5 seconds to reconnect, but if it cannot, Beaker gives you a
    chance to save a copy of your notebook locally.

    **Why are you asking for my email address?**

    So that we can notify you of future releases, including in case of
    an important security update.

    You can unsubscribe from our email list at any time and continue
    using Beaker.  We use MailChimp to manage the list so you can
    trust the controls will work.

    **How does Beaker relate to the IPython Notebook?**

    Beaker uses an [IPython](http://ipython.org) kernel for the backend of its Python
    plugins.  Many thanks to the IPython team for their great
    architecture, and for making their work available to all.

    Because the backend is shared, and Beaker can open IPython
    notebooks and convert them to its own format, you may find Beaker
    is mostly compatible with IPython (widgets are not supported).

    **How do I report a bug?**

    Please use
    [Github](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/issues/new)
    to report bugs.  Look in the [Javascript
    console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers)
    of your web browser for any errors and include them in the report.
    On Windows and Linux, look in the terminal or shell where you
    started Beaker for any errors or stack traces, and include them
    too.  On Mac, use the Console application (in the
    Applications/Utilities folder) and search for "Beaker" to find
    any errors and stack traces.  Finally, please describe your hardware,
    operating system, and web browser, and include their versions as
    well.  Thank you for your feedback.

    **Where can I put an image or other static file so that my HTML can find it?**

    Inside the Beaker application itself is a folder accessible to the
    web server that's part of Beaker.  On the Mac, if you install
    Beaker in the usual location, that would be
    `/Applications/Beaker.app/Contents/Resources/dist/src/main/web`.
    Create a folder in there called "images", copy your files to it,
    and then in an HTML cell you can refer to `<img src="images/foo.jpg">`.  
    On Windows and Linux, `src/main/web` is located in the same folder
    as the `beaker.command` script.

    Note that if you do this, the images will not work if you share
    the notebook with someone else.  We are planning on a better solution
    for this, see [Issue #430](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/issues/430).

    ## Installing and launching Beaker

    **Can I change the heap size for Groovy?**

    Yes. To customize the heap size, launch Beaker like this:

    `beaker.command  --plugin-option Groovy:-Xmx8g`

    Or you can edit your [beaker.pref.json](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Language-Preferences) file, and get that configuration every time you run Beaker.

    **Can I make the server accessible across the net?**

    Yes.  Start it like this:

    `beaker.command --public-server`

    The server will generate a password for you, and print it on the
    console.  Connect to the printed URL (note that it will be HTTPS,
    meaning encryption is used to prevent snooping) and enter the
    password.

    You should also use this option if you run Beaker on a computer
    where untrusted people can log in.

    **How do I give command-line options on the Mac?**

    Using the terminal, the contents of the app are visible.  Assuming
    you have it installed in the normal location you can run it like
    this:

    `/Applications/Beaker.app/Contents/Resources/dist/beaker.command --help`

    **Where do the server logs and error messages show up on Mac?**
 
    Run the Console application to see the debug output from the
    Beaker server.  The Console application should be in the Applications/Utilities folder.

    **On the Mac, IPython fails to start, or runs the wrong version of python.**

    Edit the [language
    preferences](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Language-Preferences)
    to tell Beaker where to find the right `ipython` binary.

    Sometimes this problem happens because Beaker finds IPython via
    the PATH.  Anaconda sets up the PATH in your .bash_profile.
    However, the Mac GUI does not read the .bash_profile when an
    application is started.  To solve this, Beaker creates a login
    shell for itself when it starts, and this process reads the
    .bash_profile.  That's all fine unless you have a special setup
    that doesn't use .bash_profile (eg you use a different shell), or
    you use a terminal to change your PATH (eg using 'source activate'
    to switch to python3) and then you start Beaker from that same
    terminal.  In these cases Beaker will not find python, or find the
    wrong one.  Until we solve this problem (see 
    [Issue #703](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/issues/703)),
    you can workaround it the the language preferences.

    **Do I have to use Anaconda?**

    No, but we recommend it because it comes with many tools for data
    science built-in.  See the wiki for how to use
    [pip or a preexisting python](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Using-a-Preexisting-Python)
    instead.

    **IPython still doesn't work.  Help!**

    Make sure your underlying IPyton install is working. Try running
    `ipython notebook` in a terminal, and see if it starts correctly
    and is version 1.0 or later.  If it's good then check its
    location with `which ipython` and enter that in your prefs.

    In particular, on Linux, look out for installing IPython with
    apt-get, as that gets you really old versions.  Instead, use
    pip, as recommended by the [install-dependencies.sh](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/blob/master/launcher/ubuntu/install-dependencies.sh) script.

    Another possible problem is on Windows, if you installed Cygwin
    before installing Anaconda, then Beaker will be confused.  The fix
    is to move Cygwin to the end of the PATH.  For more information, see the
    [wiki](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Cygwin-Compatibility).

    **What's the difference between IPython and Python3?**

    We apologize for the confusing names.  IPython in Beaker runs the
    Python2 language, and Python3 runs Python3.  Both use IPython
    backends of any recent version (1.x, 2.x, or 3.x).  Eventually we
    will rename IPython to Python2, or just Python.

    **After upgrading to Yosemite (Mac OS X 10.10), R fails**

    If you get an error about "cairo.so", just reinstall XQuartz.

    **How do I load more Javascript libraries?**

    This is unfortunately more difficult than it should be.  A new
    UI should be available soon, but in the meantime follow the
    instructions and example in [Issue #421](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/issues/421).

    **Is there a more recent version available?**

    See the [prerelease Docker container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/beakernotebook/beaker-prerelease/).
