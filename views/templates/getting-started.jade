  We have published a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/beakernotebook/beaker/", target="_blank", onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'download', 'Link', 'docker']);">Docker
  container</a> with Beaker and all supported languages built right
  in.  On Mac and Linux this is the fastest way to get started.  See the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/beakernotebook/beaker/", target="_blank", onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'download', 'Link', 'docker']);">wiki with instructions</a> on how to run it.

  There are <a href="/downloads",
  target="_blank">Electron versions</a> of Beaker that work like
  native applications with regular windows and menus instead of
  running inside a web browser.

p.block.
  And there's a portable version for Windows that you can download as a zip file.
  It stores all its preferences and temporary files inside itself, so it works
  well from a thumb drive.  See the <a href="/downloads">Downloads Archive</a> page.

p.block.
  On the Mac, if you have brew, you can just say: "brew cask install beaker".

  For a page with simple HTML links to all previous releases for all platforms, see our <a href="/downloads">Downloads Archive</a> page.
