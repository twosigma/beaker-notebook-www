as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-submission-of-contributions-">5. Submission of Contributions.</h4>
<p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

<p>In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<h4 id="9-accepting-warranty-or-additional-liability-">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</h4>
<p>While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
